Quote = "Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets Suede
Timbs on my feets makes my cipher complete Whether cruising in a Sikh's cab, or
Montero Jeep I can't call it, the beats make me falling asleep I keep falling,
but never falling six feet deep I'm out for presidents to represent me, I'm out
for presidents to represent me, I'm out for dead presidents to represent me, "
